# There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]).
# The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]).
# The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

# Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths
# that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if i==0 or j==0:
                    dp[i][j]=1
                    continue
                dp[i][j]= dp[i-1][j]+dp[i][j-1]
        return dp[-1][-1]
